# InterviewDemo
This is a small UE4 project (built from the FPS template) used to demonstrate some simple gameplay features that are nearly all implemented with Blueprints. I've included screenshots of those blueprints in the [Screenshots/Blueprints](Screenshots/Blueprints) folder so that they can be viewed without having to open the project in Unreal.

As of now, there are a number of Crates in the level
![Crates](https://github.com/AaronMike/InterviewDemo/blob/main/Screenshots/Game/Crates.png?raw=true)

that explode when enough damage has been done to them (currently two shots).

There is also a "terminal" that the Player can interact with to deposit coins that they've picked up.

The terminal is interacted with by holding 'E'

and require a few seconds to deposit the points.

The terminal will then reflect the number of coins that have since been deposited.
